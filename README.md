Source data for flg22 peptide array and Pseudomonas mutation scans for bacterial swimming motility.


Additional information on large-scale source datasets of the manuscript: Signatures of antagonistic pleiotropy in a bacterial flagellin epitope.:

•	1_B_raw_data_motility – source data for Figures 1B-D, 1G, S1C, 3A, S3A-C, 5A, S7C and S7I. In the excel file displays raw data obtained for the 412 allelic variants of FliC and processed data where toutliers were removed using the ROUT test implemented in GraphPad PRISM (Q = 5%). Each variant has an assigned barcode (from 1-419) – see the Table S2 for flg22 sequences with their associated barcodes. For barcodes highlighted in red no motility data was obtained (NA).
•	2_A_raw_data_flg22 array - source data for Figures 2A, 2D-G, S2, 3A and S3A and S3C. The dataset is divided into 5 categories based on the flg22 peptide variant tested in the mutational scan –see S2A. The interaction scores were calculated from the raw data and are displayed in Table S2.
